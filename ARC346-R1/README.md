## Title
### AWS ML at the Edge: Building Production-intended Solutions
## Description
Machine learning and IoT have become commonplace words in the enterprise workplace. Even in our homes we have ML-enabled IoT devices (weâ€™re looking at you, Amazon Alexa). But what does it look like to combine ML and IoT at the edge in a production environment? Join us in a discussion about how we built scalable production-intended ML solutions at the edge for many AWS customers. From detecting cracks in wheels on heavy machinery to automated inventory tracking in factories, we show you the results of our experiments and best practices learned the hard way, all while leveraging existing AWS services.
