## Generative Adversarial Networks
## Description
In this workshop, you learn about generative adversarial networks (GANs). One advantage of GANs is that they can be used to apply machine learning to creative tasks. Using Amazon SageMaker, you work through a hands-on example that applies GANs to music creation, allowing you to learn how to apply generative methods to your own training and input data.
