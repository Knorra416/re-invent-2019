## Building Serverless Machine-learning Workflows
## Description
Modern machine-learning workflows leverage AWS services such as Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Forecast, and Amazon Comprehend to extract, validate, mutate, and enrich your data. Some drive transactional systems that use ML to generate metadata, others derive insights by visualizing customer-interaction sentiment. All share a common challenge: orchestrating a combination of sequential and parallel steps fulfilled by independent microservices. Join us as we examine how workflows can be used to manage that orchestration in a way that's scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain and run. We contrast two approaches for creating such workflows: a traditional monolithic approach and a serverless approach utilizing AWS Step Functions.
