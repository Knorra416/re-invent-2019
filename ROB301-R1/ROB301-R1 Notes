ROB301-R1 Notes
1.	What is a robot?
    a.	A robot is an autonomous machine capable pf sense its environment. It performs tasks in this environment.
    b.	Robot development follows the same framework to software development
        i.	Testing is done in simulation, physical tests come later
    c.	ROS (robot operating system) open source library
    d.	Gazebo physics-based system to help with simulation
2.	Robomaker offerings
    a.	Cloud extensions for ROS library
    b.	Simulation environment
    c.	Fleet management for robot code and deploy new code to entire fleets
3.	Benefits of simulation testing
    a.	Safety
    b.	Repeatability
    c.	Regression test behaviors, A/B testing
        i.	Waves of long running tests to asses quality metrics
        ii.	Performance testing, how well am I doing over time
    d.	Parallel tests, much faster than real time
    e.	Scenarios/ randomization
4.	CI/CD capabilities for robotic deployment
    a.	Costly for QA engineers and dev ops engineers to integrate simulation into pipeline
5.	Specifications of simulation
    a.	Tools used AWS Robomaker, AWS Code pipeline, AWS Codebuild
        i.	Push up to Github triggers deployment
        ii.	Simulation launched with lambda
    b.	One test per simulation job is one option
        i.	One simulation with multiple test jobs is another option, based on preference
    c.	Only pay for simulation compute time
6.	iRobot testing and simulation
    a.	25 million robots sold
    b.	Build the Roomba!
    c.	More overall code, more reuse of code, means harder to test physically
    d.	War stories
        i.	Several robots on a common base
        ii.	Physical tests compete for time, space, and resources
        iii.	Hardware versions play a part as well
        iv.	Baseline testing takes about six weeks to get to prod
