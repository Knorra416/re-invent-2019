## Deep Learning with PyTorch
## Description
PyTorch is a deep-learning framework that is becoming popular, especially for rapid prototyping of new models. You can get started easily with PyTorch using Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service, to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. In this workshop, we build a natural-language-processing model to analyze text.
