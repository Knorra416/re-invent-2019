## Amazon SageMaker RL: Solving Business Problems with RL and Bandits
## Description
In reinforcement learning (RL), an RL agent learns in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions, and can make sophisticated multi-step decisions. As a result, RL has broad applicability in robotics, industrial control, finance, HVAC, dialog systems, online advertising, and more. This workshop provides practitioners with hands-on experience building and deploying RL agents from scratch. We use examples from two scenarios: one where the environment can be simulated (computer games, resource allocation simulators, etc.) and one where it cannot be and the agent learns in a live environment (recommender systems, trading bots, etc.).
