ANT202-R1 Notes

1.	EMR 5.28 has a 2.43x runtime improvement over version 5.16 in benchmark test
    a.	Improvements for both short and long running queries
2.	Optimization Deep Dive
    a.	Configuration
        i.	5.22+ allows instance specific scaling of EBS volume
        ii.	Sometimes its enough to increase volume storage instead of spinning up new instances
        iii. Dynamic Partition Pruning
            1.	Any static query (where value in list or where value ==) spark can dynamically prune partitions for you
            2.	This DOES NOT happen when your where statement isnâ€™t static (e.g. subqueries)
            3.	Reduces the shuffling of data and speeds up execution, possibly adding more partitions (if balanced) can help with this.

        iv.	Driver/ Executor configuration
            1.	Balance between spark executor (not too small or large) size is the sweet spot.
            2.	Default config ballpark 4 cores per executor, choosing the memory size by instance type should average to 4 cores per node
            3.	Spark default uses native heap (10%), helped to increase this size
    b.	The goal is reasonable defaults to stop the need for user tuning
        i.	All of the above are on by default
        ii.	Keep up to date on versions to continually improve query performance
