ARC340-R Notes

1.	What is the hard part of ML?
    a.	The hard part of ML is not the ML, it is the massive ongoing effort to maintain ML systems. Easy to built but expensive to maintain.
2.	Model Development Life Cycle (MDLC)
    a.	Data sourcing (data engineer)
    b.	Data quality assurance (data engineer)
    c.	Feature engineering (data engineer)
    d.	Model Development (research scientist)
    e.	Model training & evaluation (research scientist)
    f.	Model deployment & inference (research scientist)
    g.	Production integration (software engineer)
    h.	Issues:
        i.	Human driven
        ii.	Slow and error prone
3.	Lessons learned to improve MDLC
    a.	Meta data store in DynamoDB for all data sources (curated availability list and info)
    b.	Every time data is published, compute column summary stats and row count
        i.	Compare these metrics to the past two previous snapshots
    c.	Feature engineereing for streaming, save down feature development incremental states so new changes can just be added instead of entire reprocessing
    d.	Codepipeline and ECR for custom model build, then train them using Sagemaker
4.	Bringing the MDLC together
    a.	How do we combine all of the model development steps together?
        i.	Step functions frameworks!
        ii.	CFN templates that contain all of the MDLC steps
        iii.	Pre-build step function systems available for MDLC
    b.	CFN plus SFN can automate a lot of the development/ deployment steps of machine learning
