## Title
### Amazon.com Automating Machine Learning Deployments at Scale
## Description
Machine learning involves more than just training models; you need to source and prepare data, engineer features, select algorithms, train and tune models, and then deploy those models and monitor their performance in production. Learn how Amazon Consumer Payments uses Amazon SageMaker, AWS Glue, AWS Step Functions, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS Batch, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), and AWS CloudFormation to automate a CI/CD framework for business-critical machine learning workloads at scale.
